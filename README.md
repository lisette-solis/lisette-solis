## Hi there üëã

My name is Lisette Sol√≠s (She/Her) and I am a technologist who recently graduated from the [Computational Analysis and Public Policy program](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) at The university of Chicago. Prior to graduate school I worked on labor rights as a product manager for [Fair Trade USA](https://www.fairtradecertified.org/). I am passionate about leveraging technology for social good and am especially interested in transportation, urban policy, and environmental sustainability.
